## Excision and Cdh-descent for Hermitian K-theory Visiting position, Summer 2023
* Leading by Dr. Vova Sosnilo at the University of Regensburg
* Trying to reconstruct ⊙ product in Poincare ∞−category which is constructed by Markus Land and Georg Tamme before in algebraic K−theory of E1 −ring spectrum.
  
## Euler Classes in Motivic Homotopy Theory Master thesis, 2023
* Supervised by Adrien Dubouloz and Daniele Faenzi at the Université de Bourgogne
* Studied six-functor formalism on motivic homotopy category
* Comparing Euler classes defined by zero section and transversal section using 6-functor formalism in motivic homotopy theory.
* Studied naïve A1 −homotopy to approach A1 −homotopy theory,

## Orbifolds Structure of the Moduli Space of Metric Ribbon Graphs Master thesis, 2021
* Supervised by Clemens Berger at the Université de Nice
* Studied ribbon graphs (combinatorial objects representing graphs embedded in a closed oriented topological surface)
* Constructed the category of ribbon graphs and build a geometrilization functor to differential manifold
* Established the structure of differential orbiford of the moduli space of metric ribbon graphs with fixed topological type

## Introduction to Infinity Category Bachelor Thesis, 2020
* Supervised by Jilong Tong, at the Capital Normal University
* Studied the model category theory, and the Joyal/ Lurie model of infinity category
* Studied the proof of the category of functors between infinity categories
