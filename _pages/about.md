I'm a M2 student majoring in mathematical physics at [Université de Bourgogne]([https://www.pku.edu.cn/](https://www.u-bourgogne.fr/)). My research interest includes Langlands program and motivic theory.

I am now at the visiting position at the University of Regensburg, supervising by Dr. Vova Sosnilo. We are trying to reconstruct ⊙ product in Poincare ∞−category which is constructed by Markus Land and Georg Tamme before in algebraic K−theory of E1−ring spectrum.
